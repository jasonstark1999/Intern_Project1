# Intern_Project1
2022 Summer Intern's first project - User's data anonymization
This project is to protect our company user's data privacy. Hence, we ought to anonymize their personal information. For instance, our customer names, policy numbers, address and phone numbers. So the input is a CSV documnet of our policy reports, we should anonymize the information above and return the revised document.
In the meanwhile, we need to normalize the customer names if any of policy has the same policy number. Also, each policy's info should remain the same after the anonymization. For instance, if the policy address is Spring St and its anonymization is Fifth St, then all Spring St in the report should be changed to Fifth St.
